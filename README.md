# PyBer Analysis

**Overview of the analysis**

PyBer was looking for some additional analysis on their ride-sharing data by city type.  I was asked to create a report that shows the total weekly fares for each city type and recap the data on how it differs by city type.  In addition, after reviewing the anaylsis, I was asked to provide some insight information on the data and make recommendations so that the CEO can make some informed decisions.

**Results of the analysis**

As you can see in the summary image below, the rural area gets the most fare per ride and driver but the least amount of total revenue in fares when comparing to the other areas.  In addition to the least amount of revenue, there are less rides and drivers in the area.  Rural areas are typically more spread out with less population.  The higher average fare is most likely due to a farther drive time.  

Suburban areas are inbetween rural and urban areas as far as total fare dollars.  Their average fare is $39.50 and brings in over 4 times the revenue of rural areas.  It is interesting to see that the ratio of total drivers and rides is .78.  The rural areas made up a little over 30% of the total fare dollars between the 3 types of areas.

The urban areas have the most total rides and drivers.  They made over 62.72% of total fares which is most likely related to poplation and the type of area.  Urban areas typically have many businesses and residential areas and a high population.  It is interesting to see that they have the lowest average fare per driver which is related to the shorter distances between areas in an urban area.  The urban area has almost 1.50 drivers for the number of rides.

When the ride-sharing data is graphed as you can see in the image below, you can see that in all areas, there is an uptick in rides in the 3rd week of February.  When looking at the suburban area, there is also a significant increase in rides at the end of April.  It is interesting to see that the urban area had 4 significant swings throughout the reporting period.  The rural area never gets over 500 rides per week with their highest rides being the beginning of April

**Summary**
After reviewing the data, I have some recommendations for PyBer.
 - During the upticks in rides, for example, the last week in February I would look at increasing the number of drivers available so that people can easily find a ride when needed.
 - When you look at the statistics for the urban area, it appears that they have the more drivers than rides.  During the slower times, I would recommend having less drivers and increase the fare.
