# PyBer Analysis

#Overview of the analysis#

PyBer was looking for some additional analysis on their ride-sharing data by city type.  I was asked to create a report that shows the total weekly fares for each city type and recap the data on how it differs by city type.  In addition, after reviewing the anaylsis, I was asked to provide some insight information on the data and make recommendations so that the CEO can make some informed decisions.
